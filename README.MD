# My GitHub Project

This is my GitHub project. I published it directly from Visual Studio Code.



# VSCode Getting started from MS Learn

Creating this repo and files as I follow along with the vscode tutorial found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/students/github-pack

Will be using this and possibly branches as I work on the repos with my kids.
